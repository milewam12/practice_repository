    <p>
        I’m a versatile, resourceful and disciplined Graphic Designer/Art Director. I have over 9 years of experience working with a wide range of clients and challenging real-world situations. I see every project as an opportunity to innovate and transform needs into imagery with a purpose: build brands.

Rolling the creative ball is something that I really enjoy and I take it serious… design is my passion! Whether I am fulfilling a role as a freelance or working alongside designers and copywriters, commitment to quality and results is what I strive for in my work.
